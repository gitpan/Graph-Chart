  overlay
            method to put an avrlay on top of the graph ( to show alarm period ... )

      use the same parameter as the new()
      if the option is already present, overwrite this option

  png_zEXt
            method to add a png data TAG 
            This tag is not a PNG standard, but allowed by the RFC
            see code in img_info.pl 
        
            my $png_out1 =$graph->png_zEXt( { eerer => 1, ggg => 'zed' } );
            this overwrite the png TAG data with the new value and return the new image

  render
            render the chart and return a png image

      my $img = $graph->render( \%tag )
   
      the hash ref contain data to put in the PNG meta tag.
      the tools img_info.pl allow to see the result.
      the tag is serialized in the png
  
      the returned value could be writted in a file like this:
      my $png_out = $graph->render();
  
        open( my $IMG, '>', $file ) or die $!;
        binmode $IMG;
        print $IMG $png_out;
        close $IMG;
    );
